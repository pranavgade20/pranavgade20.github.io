<h1>Hi, I'm Pranav Gade</h1>

<p>And this page is a quine. What is that? Well, a quine is a program that produces its source code as its output.</p>

<p>But before I tell you more about that, here is a bit about me:</p>

<p>I am a 18y.o. student, currently pursuing B.Tech. CS&AI(Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence) at IIIT-L(Indian Institute of Information Technology, Lucknow). You can find my resume <a href="pranav-gade-resume.pdf">here</a></p>

<p>I started exploring computers when I was 7, when I got my hands on a QBASIC manual. I have loved programming and computers ever since. Nowadays, I like Java programming and am exploring networking and minecraft modding.</p>

<p>I was a Google Code-in 2018 Grand Prize winner for my contributions to KDE Community, and was invited to visit Google's HQ in California!</p>

<p>I am a FOSS evangelist, and therefore a Linux user(i use arch btw :p)</p>

<p>I am kinda lazy, and love automating stuff, like <a href="https://github.com/pranavgade20/FabricHax">this minecraft mod</a> that makes your life easier.</p>

<p>I love to code useful apps, and participating in hackathons like PennApps.</p>

<p>I also reverse engineer software and love taking part in CTFs. Like picoCTF 2019, where my team was ranked 52nd out of 15817</p>

<p>One of my hobbies is making procedural digital art. You can find some of my best efforts <a href="art/art.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I don't really like Competitive Programming, but I had qualified for INOI(Indian National Informatics Olympiad), the precursor to IOI(International Olympiad in Informatics)</p>

<p>I like making quirky stuff like <a href="">this website</a>(it is a quine), and recursion ;p</p>

<p>I also enjoy doing Unicode voodoo like <a href="https://twitter.com/pranavgade20">my twitter account</a> name</p>

<h3>How does this page work?</h3>

<p>This all started from the book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, by Douglas Hofstadter. It is a really good book covering a lot of topics, but it was the book that introduced the idea of a 'quine', a program that prints its source code. This page is inspired by<a href="https://youtu.be/gdSlcxxYAA8">this</a>talk by Dylan Beattie.</p>
<p>But how does it work? Well, this page uses a bunch of weird HTML and CSS tricks to insert the tags, as well as hide them. Here is all the voodoo that makes this possible:</p>
<p>
<style>
html::before{content:'<html>'} html::after{content:'</html>'}
html{max-width:99ch; padding:1ch; margin:auto; color:#333; font-size:1.2em}
head::before{content:'<head>'} head::after{content:'</head>'}
meta::before{content:'<meta charset="utf-8" name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">'}
title::before{content:'<title>'} title::after{content:'</title>'}
body::before{content:'<body>'} body::after{content:'</body>'}
h1::before{content:'<h1>'} h1::after{content:'</h1>'}
h3::before{content:'<h3>'} h3::after{content:'</h3>'}
h5::before{content:'<h5>'} h5::after{content:'</h5>'}
p::before{content:'<p>'} p::after{content:'</p>'}
table::before{content:'<table>'} table::after{content:'</table>'}
tr::before{content:'<tr>'} tr::after{content:'</tr>'}
td::before{content:'<td>';} td::after{content:'</td>';}
a[href]::before{content: "<a href='" attr(href) "'>"} a::after{content:'</a>'} a{display:inline; text-decoration:none}
style::before{content:'<style>'} style::after{content:'<\/style>'}
style{font-size: 0.4em}
*::before, *::after{color:#aebfd0; font-weight:100; font-size:0.8em; margin:0.3em}
*{display:block; font-family:Monospace}
</style>
