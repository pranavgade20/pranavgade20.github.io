<h2>Hi, I'm Pranav Gade</h2>

<p>And this page is a quine. What is that? Well, a quine is a program that produces its own source code as its output.</p>

<p>But before I tell you more about that, here is a bit about me:</p>
<p>I am a 17y.o. high school student from Rao Junior College of Science, Andheri, Mumbai. You can find my resume here.</p>

<p>Now, the fun stuff:</p>

<p>I started exploring computers when I was 7, when I got my hands on a QBASIC manual. It wasn't written for 7 year olds, which might be why it took me a year to go through that monster.</p>

<p>I am a FOSS evangelist, and therefore a Linux user. I was a Google Code-in 2018 Grand Prize winner for my contributions to KDE Community.</p>

<p>I love to code useful apps, like this Family Tree app that helps you keep track of your family tree(trust me, it's a big help, especially if you are Indian)</p>

<p>I also reverse engineer software and love taking part in CTFs. Like picoCTF 2019, where my team was ranked 52nd out of 15817</p>

<p>One of my hobbies is making procedural digital art. Click here to awe at some of my best efforts.</p>

<p>I also do just enough Competitive Programming to qualify for INOI(Indian National Informatics Olympiad), the precursor to IOI(International Olympiad in Informatics)</p>

<p>I also enjoy doing Unicode vodoo like this.(Click here if all you see is a bunch of boxes)</p>

<h3>How does this page work?</h3>

<p>This all started from the book GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, by Douglas Hofstadter. It is a really good book covering a lot of topics, but it was the book that introduced the idea of a 'quine', a program that prints its own source code. I was inspired to create this page by this talk by Dylan Beattie.</p>
<p>But how does it work? Well, this page uses a bunch of weird HTML and CSS tricks to insert the tags, as well as hide them. Click here for an in-depth technical description.</p>
