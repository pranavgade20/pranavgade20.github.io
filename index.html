<h1>Hi, I'm Pranav Gade</h1>

<p>And this page is a quine. What is that? Well, a quine is a program that produces its source code as its output.</p>

<p>But before I tell you more about that, here is a bit about me:</p>

<p>I am a 18y.o. student, currently pursuing B.Tech. CS&AI(Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence) at IIIT-L(Indian Institute of Information Technology, Lucknow). You can find my resume <a href="resume.pdf">here</a></p>

<p>I started exploring computers when I was 7, when I got my hands on a QBASIC manual. I have loved programming and computers ever since. Nowadays, I like Java programming and am exploring networking and minecraft modding.</p>

<p>I was a Google Code-in 2018 Grand Prize winner for my contributions to KDE Community, and was invited to visit Google's HQ in California!</p>

<p>I am a FOSS evangelist, and therefore a Linux user(i use arch btw)</p>

<p>I am kinda lazy, and love automating stuff, like <a href="https://github.com/pranavgade20/FabricHax">this minecraft mod</a> that makes your life easier.</p>

<p>I love to code useful apps, and participating in hackathons like PennApps.</p>

<p>I also reverse engineer software and love taking part in CTFs. Like picoCTF 2019, where my team was ranked 52nd out of 15817</p>

<p>One of my hobbies is making procedural digital art. You can find some of my best efforts <a href="art/art.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I don't really like Competitive Programming, but I had qualified for INOI(Indian National Informatics Olympiad), the precursor to IOI(International Olympiad in Informatics)</p>

<p>I like making quirky stuff like <a href="">this website</a>(it is a quine), and recursion :P</p>

<p>I also enjoy doing Unicode voodoo like <a href="https://twitter.com/pranavgade20">my twitter account</a> name</p>

<h3>How does this page work?</h3>

<p>This all started from the book GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, by Douglas Hofstadter. It is a really good book covering a lot of topics, but it was the book that introduced the idea of a 'quine', a program that prints its source code. This page is inspired by<a href="https://youtu.be/gdSlcxxYAA8">this</a>talk by Dylan Beattie.</p>
<p>But how does it work? Well, this page uses a bunch of weird HTML and CSS tricks to insert the tags, as well as hide them. Here is all the voodoo that makes this possible:</p>
<p>
<style>* { display:block; font-family:Monospace; margin:0.4em; padding:0; text-decoration:none} a,code,em,strong {display:inline} </style>
<style> style, blockquote { white-space: pre-wrap;}</style>
<style> html::before{content:'<html>'}html::after {content:'<\/html>'}head::before{content:'<head>'}head::after {content:'<\/head>'}</style>
<style>p::before {content:'<p>'}p:after {content:'</p>'}title::before {content:'<title>'}title::after {content:'<\/title>'}</style>
<style>body::before {content:'<body>'}body::after {content:'<\/body>'}h1::before {content:'<h1>'}h1::after {content:'<\/h1>'}</style>
<style>h3::before {content:'<h3>'}h3::after {content:'<\/h3>'}h5::before {content:'<h5>'}h5::after {content:'<\/h5>'}</style>
<style>p::before {content:'<p>'}p::after {content:'<\/p>'}a::before {content:'<a>'}a::after {content:'<\/a>'}</style>
<style>table::before {content:'<table>'}table::after {content:'<\/table>'}tr::before {content:'<tr>'}tr::after {content:'<\/tr>'}</style>
<style>td::before {content:'<td>';}td::after {content:'<\/td>';}</style>
<style>a[href]::before {content: "<a href='" attr(href) "'>"}</style>
<style>style::before {content:'<style>'}style::after {content:'<\/style>'}style::first-line {font-size: 0.2em; line-height: 0}</style>
<style>*::before,*::after {color:#aebfd0;font-weight:100;font-size:0.8em;}</style>
<style>meta::before{content:'<meta charset="utf-8" name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">'}</style>
<style>html {max-width:90ch;padding:1ch;margin:auto;color:#333;font-size:1.2em;}</style>
