        <description>You are sitting in &amp;lt;the class you hate&amp;gt;. The teacher is droning on about something and you are bored. You spot your friends sitting across the room. Ugh! Why did they have to sit there! Luckily, they appear just as bored as you are. You want to talk somehow, so you need to think about something creative. Hand gestures? Too much effort, plus you would be in trouble if you were caught.</description>

        <title>A HTML Quine</title>

        <description>Background A quine is a program that produces its source code as its output. Now, although HTML is not a programming language, but a markup language, CSS is a turing complete language as long as you consider the accompanying HTML as well. So, this is technically a description of a HTML+CSS quine, but I think saying HTML is sufficient.
I was introduced to the idea of a quine in the book GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, by Douglas Hofstadter.</description>
