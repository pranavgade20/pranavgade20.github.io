They make the Internet accessible, and parse weird-looking HTML into a beautiful document. However, organizing and looking for tabs in modern browsers is a mess. I often have quite a few tabs open from the same website, where the title is often something like Website name - page name.

I was introduced to the idea of a quine in the book GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, by Douglas Hofstadter.</description><dc:creator>Pranav Gade</dc:creator><category>quine</category><category>html</category></item></channel></rss>
